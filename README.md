# F1Fantasy
Console (for now) program to help determine optimal F1 fantasy moves each week

Programming goals:
1 - while and for loops
2 - creating, managing and importing a library in a separate file
3 - wokring with tuples

# Phase 1 - Program will determine recommended fantasy moves based on a point system from a total of FP performance for standard weekends
# Phase 2 - Include update to account for sprint weekends
# Phase 3 - errors for entering duplicate and non-existant finishing positions
