# F1Fantasy
Console (for now) program to help determine optimal F1 fantasy moves each week

## Programming goals:
1. While and for loops
2. Creating, managing and importing a library in a separate file
3. Wokring with tuples

## Phases
+ Phase 1 - Program will determine recommended fantasy moves based on a point system from a total of FP performance for standard weekends
+ Phase 2 - Include update to account for sprint weekends
+ Phase 3 - Errors for entering duplicate and non-existant finishing positions
