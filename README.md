# F1Fantasy
The primary goal of this program is developing my programing skills, meaning there may be less than optimal choices of functions or other code (i.e. the "drivers in/out" fuction in the "drivers info" file is to show list alteration skills and not necessarily what I would choose to do in a professional setting)

Program based on F1 free practice sessions to help recommend optimal fantasy team moves
